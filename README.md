# California-Wildfire-Analysis-Project
Analyzed and visualized California wildfire data (2024â€“2025) using Python and Tableau. Built an interactive dashboard with 3D maps, heatmaps, and KPIs. Developed ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict fire spread and uncover patterns in fire behavior over time.
