# California-Wildfire-Analysis-Project
Analyzed and visualized California wildfire data (2024‚Äì2025) using Python and Tableau. Built an interactive dashboard with 3D maps, heatmaps, and KPIs. Developed ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict fire spread and uncover patterns in fire behavior over time.

üîç Objective (for the California Wildfire Analysis Project)

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to analyze, visualize, and model wildfire activity in California using real-world perimeter data from 2024‚Äì2025. The project aims to identify spatial and temporal patterns in wildfire occurrences, understand the scale and distribution of affected areas, and explore predictive modeling techniques to estimate fire spread potential. This work combines geospatial analysis, time-series exploration, and interactive dashboard design to support data-driven insights in the context of climate change and disaster management.

Specific Goals:

1) Data Acquisition & Cleaning
    Ingest wildfire perimeter data from state and federal agencies
    Clean, standardize, and preprocess date, type, and area-related fields
   
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Examine frequency, location, size, and source of fire incidents
    Identify seasonal trends and source-wise contributions
   
3) Geospatial and Temporal Visualization
    Create 2D and 3D spatial maps to visualize fire perimeters
    Use Tableau to build a dynamic dashboard with animated timelines, filters, and heatmaps

5) Dashboard Design
    Build interactive visual elements including KPI tiles, maps, trendlines, and heatmaps
    Enable real-time filtering by fire source, year, and display status

7) Predictive Modeling
    Develop a machine learning model (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict area burned
    Engineer relevant features such as month, fire type, and historical behavior
    Interpret model results using feature importance scores

8) Insight Generation
    Translate visual and model-based findings into actionable insights for climate risk awareness
    Highlight the value of data analytics in understanding and responding to environmental hazards

Broader Purpose:

This project not only demonstrates technical capabilities in data science, visualization, and machine learning, but also addresses a real-world issue that is growing more urgent with climate change. It serves as a tool to educate, inform, and inspire future data-driven work in environmental analytics and public safety.
